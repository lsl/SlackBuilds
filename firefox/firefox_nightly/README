Firefox Nightly (These builds are for testing purposes only)
      
Firefox Nightly is a developmental channel for new Firefox releases. 
It's designed to showcase the more experimental builds of Firefox.  
The Nightly channel allows users to experience the newest Firefox
innovations in an unstable environment and provide feedback on
features and performance to help determine what makes the final
release.

This package is created from binary tarballs provided by mozilla.
As Firefox Nightly has nightly updates I have also provided a script
"firefox_nightly.Update" This script checks for updates, and writes the 
latest available tarball info to "firefox_nightly.Update.conf", If the 
.conf file exists the build script will use that information to download 
the latest tarball and create the new package. Ignoring version/build numbers 
written in the script. This is simply for convenience as I feel manually modifying 
the SlackBuild each day is not feasible.
